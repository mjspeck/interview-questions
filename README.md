# Data Science Interview Questions

The idea of this repository would be to have a community driven hub of interview questions for data science / data analysis / machine learning-related jobs that people have encountered in their job searches. Initially, this will start off as a simple list of questions, but hopefully will become more organized and robust overtime.

## Table of Contents

There are currently four question topics covered in this repo; each topic has its own document.

1. [Algorithms](algorithms.md)
1. [Python](python.md)
1. [SQL](sql.md)
1. [Statistics](statistics.md)

## Contributing

Since the value of this project comes from crowdsourcing interview questions data science candidates have encountered, contributing is not only allowed, but strongly encouraged. Feel free to fork this repo and submit any questions / changes you'd like to through a pull request.
